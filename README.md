## Diabetes-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machine
This project demonstrates how a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier can be used to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic data. It is my first machine learning model and serves as a foundational step in exploring supervised classification techniques using Python and scikit-learn.
## 📌 Key Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Training an SVM classifier
